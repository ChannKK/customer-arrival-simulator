# Supermarket Customer Arrival Simulator
In this simulation, we will be modelling the queueing system at supermarket checkout counters. 
The objective of this simulation is to create a representation of customer arrivals and their queueing behaviour at three counters: 
two normal checkout counters and one express checkout counter.

## Overview
By generating the tables for inter-arrival time and service time, we will simulate the time it takes for each counter to 
process a customerâ€™s items and the time between the arrival of consecutive customers, respectively. 
This simulation will consider factors such as the number of items acquired by each customer.

## Steps
1. **Main Function:** The simulator starts by entering the `main()` function. It displays four tables: the table of inter-arrival time, and the tables of service time for counters 1, 2, and 3.
2. **Input from User:** The user is prompted to input the number of customers (minimum of 5) and choose a type of random number generator for interarrival time and service time.
3. **Simulation Table Generation:** The simulator generates an overall simulation table after calculating the inter-arrival time and arrival time. The random numbers for 'RN for Interarrival time' and 'Number of items acquired' are generated by the simulator. The counter number is determined based on the number of items acquired by the customers.
4. **Arrival Messages:** The simulator displays the arrival message of each customer at the specific counters.
5. **Service and Departure:** The simulation table and displayed message for service and departure are shown for each counter (Counter 1, Counter 2, and Counter 3).
6. **Evaluation:** The simulator evaluates the results and displays the output.
7. **Goodbye Message:** A goodbye message is displayed when the simulator ends successfully.

## Usage
To use the simulator, follow these steps:
1. Run the `main()` function.
2. Input the number of customers and choose a type of random number generator.
3. Follow the prompts to proceed with the simulation.
4. View the output and evaluation results.
